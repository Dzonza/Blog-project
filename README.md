Blog Project

My first blog project using django framework.

Website where you can 
-register
-login
-read posts
-create posts
-edit your posts
-comment on others posts
-save posts to read later

activate venv to get all the necessary packages to start, in cmd find the project and type
.\venv\Scripts\activate

to run the server
py manage.py runserver

Have fun :)
